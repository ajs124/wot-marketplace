    "longDescription": "# ESP Light Sensor\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nself contained - runs on micropython\r\n\r\n## What to Change\r\n\r\n* This connects to a WiFi with SSID and PW specified in the beginning of `main.py`. You should change them according to your WiFi setup\r\n* The provided TD will be updated in a new network since the IP address of the ESP will change\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n- You will flash the program via the serial port. Make sure that you have read/write rights to the port by following [this guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html).\r\n- Get the micropython firmware from [here](http://micropython.org/download#esp8266) or use version provided in at esp8266 folder.\r\n- Run `pip install esptool` to install the tool that allows you to flash programs to the ESP board\r\n- Run `esptool.py --port <dev location, e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0> erase_flash` to remove the previous program or firmware\r\n- Run `esptool.py --port <dev location> --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect -fm dio 0 <name of the firmware>` to download the firmware into ESP board. This is not your program, just the firmware.\r\n- Upload the `main.py` script to ESP8266 with `ampy` following the instructions from [Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-basics-load-files-and-run-code/install-ampy)\r\n  - Install ampy: `pip install adafruit-ampy`\r\n  - Check that it is installed with `ampy --help`\r\n  - You can run the code with `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0  run main.py`\r\n  - You can upload it as the main program via `ampy --port /dev/ttyUSB0 put main.py /main.py`\r\n- to use the REPL of the ESP8266, connect it to your USB port and use a serial communication program. Example under Linux: `picocom <dev location> -b115200`\r\n  - You will need to press enter to enter into the console.\r\n  - To exit, press CTRL+A+X\r\n- to find out the MAC address of the ESP, follow the instructions on https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?t=1890\r\n- assign a static IP adress to this MAC on the router's configuration page\r\n  - You may not see it in the DHCP clients list\r\n- When you see the LED lit, it means that it has connected to WiFi",
